        Friday, March 29, 1912, Captain Robert F. Scott writes his last words in his diary:
        "For God's sake, take care of our own." It is found in a tent in Antarctica 700 km 
        from the South Pole. He is accompanied by Lieutenant Bowers and Doctor Wilson, 
        all of them in an extreme situation, and aware of the inevitability of the outcome. 
        Outside, with temperatures around -40 ºC, a terrible blizzard that seems to have no end
        keeps them immobilized. Inside the situation is not much better, they are completely exhausted 
        after almost 5 months of expedition. Under normal conditions, they would be less than two days'
        walk away from reaching what they had called the "Large Ton Deposit", located less than 20 km away.
        Reaching this deposit, located at 79º 29' S, is essential to be able to return to the base 
        located on Ross Island. Even so, they would still have more than 200 km to go. 
        By the end of the expedition, but unable to reach this supply, death inexorably approaches them,
        and they are aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The warehouse is located in the middle of the immense plain with boxes
        stacked up to a height of 2 meters. He decided to establish it further away
        than initially planned. A year ago he made a decision that would be key to the outcome
        of the expedition. Affected by the suffering that the horses went through 
        -one of them was completely bloodied- he ordered to establish the provisions 
        56 km earlier than planned, at 80º latitude, since he could not violate his convictions
        by advancing a few more kilometers.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have been trying to advance for days, but the blizzard hits them hard, 
        making it impossible for them to advance. In addition, the low temperatures cause the march 
        to be desperately slow. Below 40º the ice floor is as rough as concrete, the friction
        of the sled with the frozen surface is huge and to overcome it requires an effort that the
        three brave Englishmen can hardly make. All this despite having lightened the load,
        since they have abandoned the theodolite, the camera and everything expendable. 
        Everything except the journals and the geological samples collected on the descent of the 
        Beardmore Glacier, the only really very heavy thing that they refuse to abandon, and that 
        would later be very valuable in validating plate tectonics. They suffer serious frostbite
        in the extremities. They only have food for two days, and fuel for one, which they also need
        to obtain water, since melting snow and ice directly in their mouths requires calories that 
        they already lack, and which, paradoxically, increases dehydration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scott keeps wondering what went wrong. As leader of the expedition, he has had to make tough 
        decisions. He was aware that the fate of 5 men would depend on the success of the planning 
        and now, inevitably, they will all die in the attempt to conquer the South Pole. 
        What has gone wrong? The planning? The diet - they are completely undernourished.
        The horses? The equipment? These and many other issues continue to frustrate Scott.
      </p>
      <p>
        After so much effort to reach their destination - on January 17 they reached the South Pole
        - they received a severe blow when they see the Norwegian flag waving, and verify that the other 
        expedition has preceded them; but without a doubt even harder is the return, with the
        death of two of his companions. First, Lieutenant Evans, giant
        and womanizer, beer lover, which occurs during the descent of the glacier; 
        and then Captain Oates who, on his 32nd birthday, leaves the store never to return. 
        They both behaved in a way exceptional, enduring pain without complaining, without 
        giving in to adversity, in an attitude of extraordinary courage. However, the
        physical problems of both slowed down the expedition, also marking their destiny, 
        and now they are unable to reach the supply point.
      </p>
      <p>
        After several attempts to resume the march, they were unable to do so due to
        adverse weather conditions. Scott tries to be animated, but the forces abandon him,
        in those moments he misses being able to continue writing in his diary, 
        with so many things to tell. But the simple task of writing something, 
        in their current conditions, was a titanic task. Malnutrition and dehydration prevent it.
        Despite his failure, he only hopes that the whole world recognizes the value of these men.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is now 100 years since one of the greatest milestones in the exploration of the planet,
        the conquest of the South Pole, which also covered of extraordinary race between 
        the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, the final winner, and the British Scott who, 
        in addition to being defeated in this competition, would pay for the attempt with his life.
        It is worth stopping to learn some details of these fascinating expeditions
        to the last unexplored corner of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the antecedents of this expedition, we can find that Amundsen participated 
        as a helmsman in the Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897, in which Cook also participated,
        and later led the first expedition that managed to cross the mythical Northwest Passage
        between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans; so he was already an accomplished and renowned explorer.
        The same thing happened with the other contender, Scott, who made a first reconnaissance
        expedition in 1900 with the ship Discovery, and where they reached 82°17' S latitude
        setting the record of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, another member of the Discovery, Ernest Shackleton, 
        made an attempt in 1907 aboard the Expedition. For which, they established their 
        base on Ross Island, and made their attempt using Manchurian ponies instead of dogs, 
        which had not given the results previously expected. However, on this occasion 
        the change did not improve much either, having to rely mainly on the shot of the 
        men themselves for transport. The expedition was about to succeed, reaching 88°23' and 
        remaining only 180 km from the Pole, making the decision to retreat at the high risk 
        of their own lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1910, aboard the Terra Nova, Scott makes a new attempt, correcting some of 
        the defects Shackleton himself observed. In this way he could achieve success,
        which he finally achieves, albeit with consequences. He uses draft dogs, horses 
        and human effort; furthermore, in a worthy commitment to technology, he also brings three
         motorized tracked sledges, although all still experimental prototypes, 
         the best of which sank during unloading. However, his fundamental bet, 
         as Shackelton did, was the horses and his own men; which was one of his 
         first mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same year the Amundsen expedition takes place. Although this explorer
        initially posits his expedition as headed for the North Pole, getting the
        Norwegian government to give him the Fram ship, a sailboat perfectly adapted to 
        polar navigation, aided by a coal engine that Amundsen himself, also in a 
        commitment to emerging technology, replaced with a diesel engine. After his departure
        from Norway, during the stopover in Madeira, he announces to the world, 
        completely by surprise, the chang in plans, and his new route to the South Pole, 
        and avoiding further stops, in order to prevent the possible receipt of return orders 
        from the Norwegian government, which might fear alienating the powerful United Kingdom.
        This change was due to the fact that the North Pole had already been conquered, 
        and the dispute between Peary and Cook over its authorship was also being settled 
        at that time, so he foresaw little recognition if he achieved that feat. 
        As traction for the sleds, Amundsen made a better decision than his opponent. 
        It was based solely on huskies, perfectly trained and knowledgeable about their handlers,
        which now functioned perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        En su planteamiento de la acometida, ambos siguieron líneas parecidas;
        estableciendo campamentos base, y depósitos de aprovisionamiento para el
        regreso. Scott lo estableció en la isla de Ross y siguió la misma ruta
        de Shackelton para el ascenso a la meseta. El último y principal de sus
        depósitos lo denominó de la "Gran Tonelada", si bien, y como ya hemos
        comentado tuvo que establecerse 56 km. antes de lo previsto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Por su lado Amundsen estableció su base en la Bahía de las Ballenas, que
        estaba situado algo más cerca de la meta que la base británica, si bien
        tenía el inconveniente de que la ruta a seguir era completamente
        desconocida. Durante el verano anterior logró establecer tres depósitos,
        en las cotas de 80º, 81º y 82º, lo que le facilitó el posterior camino
        de regreso. Además, Amundsen no puso reparos para alimentar a los
        perros, e incluso a ellos mismos, con los perros fallecidos o
        directamente sacrificados cuando ya no eran necesarios, lo que no
        hicieron los británicos por la oposición del propio Scott.
      </p>
      <p>
        Con el verano austral ambas expediciones parten hacia su destino. Los
        noruegos el 19 de octubre, y los británicos el 1 de noviembre. Ya desde
        sus primeros pasos los perros de Amundsen funcionan a la perfección, si
        bien la mitad de ellos son sacrificados al alcanzar la parte superior de
        la meseta, al ser ya innecesarios. Por el contrario, la combinación de
        perros, caballos y vehículos motorizados de Scott no dan los resultados
        esperados.
      </p>
      <p>
        El 14 de diciembre los noruegos alcanzan su meta, el Polo Sur, mientras
        los británicos en esos momentos sólo han llegado a la meseta superior,
        con poco más de la mitad del camino realizado. Aquellos comienzan el
        retorno, con el tiempo empeorando para desgracia de los británicos.
        Scott logra llegar al Polo el 17 de enero, mientras que Amundsen, con un
        equipo ya exhausto, consigue alcanzar el primer depósito de provisiones
        y reponer fuerzas. En la meta, los británicos encuentran la bandera
        noruega y una carta de Amundsen dirigida a ellos. La famosa foto que
        tomaron refleja el abatimiento que debieron sentir.
      </p>
      <p>
        El camino de regreso para el equipo de Scott fue extremadamente duro,
        mucho más que para los noruegos, por las extremas condiciones
        climáticas. Y mientras que el 25 de enero, estos llegan a su destino
        final, la Bahía de las Ballenas, para entonces Scott y su equipo aún no
        han alcanzado los 88º. El 7 de febrero alcanzan el límite de la meseta
        completamente extenuados, y con un tiempo increíblemente atroz deben
        invertir más de un mes en su descenso, y en ese intervalo se produce la
        muerte del primer caído, Evans. El 17 de marzo se produce la muerte de
        Oates que, imposibilitado de continuar, decide abandonar de noche el
        campamento sin avisar, a fin de evitar ser una carga para sus
        compañeros, que se negaban a abandonarlo. Pero ese generoso sacrificio
        ya es inútil pues finalmente, el 20 de marzo, se ven detenidos
        definitivamente por un gran temporal, habiendo agotado ya ampliamente
        todas sus fuerzas. Se encontraban a 18 km. del depósito de la Gran
        Tonelada, que ya habrían alcanzado de haber estado ubicado en el lugar
        previsto, y quizá salvado sus vidas e incluso la de Oates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aunque la expedición de Amundsen estuvo mejor preparada, la de Scott,
        aún con sus defectos, todavía podría haber tenido éxito de no haber
        contado con una climatología extraordinariamente adversa, uno de los
        peores inviernos de los registrados en todo el siglo XX, e incluso la
        mala suerte del momento elegido para establecer el depósito para la
        vuelta, donde también debido al mal tiempo debieron adoptar su dura
        decisión.
      </p>
      <p>
        El diario de Scott, encontrado junto a su cadáver, refleja su
        extraordinaria personalidad, y contribuyó a que su expedición tuviese,
        si cabe, mayor reconocimiento que la del propio vencedor. Y aún hoy, ya
        transcurridos 100 años desde aquella proeza, no es posible permanecer
        indiferente al leer su última anotación: "Resistiremos hasta el final,
        pero la muerte ya no puede estar muy lejos. Es una pena, pero creo que
        ya no podré seguir escribiendo. Por el amor de Dios, cuidad de los
        nuestros". Como ya dijera Stefan Zweig de esta trágica historia: "Es la
        más grandiosa tragedia de todos los tiempos, la que, de cuando en
        cuando, logra crear algún poeta, y la vida miles de veces".
      </p>
      <p>
        The publication of the diary somewhat obscured Amundsen's triumph. 
        He even undervalued his own difficulties, presenting them as lesser than they really were.
        On his victory, after traveling 1,280 km in 55 days he wrote in his diary: 
        "Reached the goal, finished the trip...I cannot say that I have reached the goal of my life. 
        The North Pole had attracted me since I was little, and there I was, in the South Pole.
        Can you imagine anything more crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, at the South Pole there is an international scientific base
        belonging to all the signatory countries of the Antarctic Treaty and bears
        the base name Amundsen-Scott; which is an explicit recognition well 
        deserved for both explorers. As a curiosity,
        indicate that it is quite displaced from the place reached 100 years ago
        by the expeditionaries. Close to the base is the so-called
        Ceremonial South Pole, where a metallic sphere is placed on a
        pedestal, surrounded by the flags of the countries, and which is located
        few meters from the actual Geographic South Pole, since it is not in a
        fixed place - it is marked only by a stake - because the entire
        area is located on a moving glacier that travels about
        10 meters per year, so every New Year's Day, the stake moves to the right.
